Below are the extensions that I have implemented in my code:

 -  I have changed the game's background to a creative commons stars beckground.
    The image is by Felix Mittermeier. It can be found here:

 -  I have designed the game so that even the aliens that are not at the bottom
    row are able to fire bolts. If bolts are sent by aliens above other aliens,
    the aliens below are not affected and only the ship is affected by
    these bolt collisions.
 -  I have added royalty free background music to the game which I have
    retrieved from incompetech.com. The song is called '8 Bit Dungeon Level'.

 -  I have also added a laser sound effect to the game, which is played when the
    spacebar is pressed and the ship shoots a bolt. I retrieved this sound
    effect from freesound.org, and it is licensed under a creative commons
    license. It has been created by Matias "Mattix" Lahoud and can be found
    using this URL: https://freesound.org/people/Mattix/sounds/413057/
 -  I have allowed users to mute the background music on the welcome screen by
    pressing the 'm' key on the keyboard.
 -  I also dynamically speed up the aliens by multiplying the current speed by
    0.97 as more of them are killed.
 -  I have animated the aliens as they move.
